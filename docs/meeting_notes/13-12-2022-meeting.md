# Notes:
- the deadline is not extended
- we can code the project first and then change the design pattern
- don't change issues from must-haves to should-haves
- we don't _really_ need an user microservice
    - we still have time to update the architecture to not add it
    - not having a user microservice is a _cleaner_ approach
    - no punishment if we have a user microservice
      - i.e. will be graded the same
- design pattern:
  - strategy pattern is most useful
  - chain of responsibility for authentication is not ok
  - avoid singleton
    - we need really good arguments for why we chose it
