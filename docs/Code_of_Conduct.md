# Code of Conduct

## Target or Ambition level

Our group collectively has high ambitions for this project and our grade target is 9.5. Furthermore, we need to be able to prevent and resolve conflicts as much as possible in order to ensure that our workflow is not compromised.

## Behaviour

We try to be supportive of each other. We make an effort to be respectful, and we try to listen to each other. However, when disagreements happen we try to form a vote collectively and ask for our teacher assistantâ€™s advice on the matter in order to reach consent.

If every member of the group feels comfortable doing so, our teaching assistant could be involved in reaching consent. We would want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with this, and that everyone feels safe and respected. We believe that consent should be a collaborative process, and that everyone involved should have a voice.

If someone is late for a group meeting, we typically wait around for a bit to see if they show up. If they don't, we might start the meeting without them. We understand that sometimes mishaps happen, and we don't want to hold anyone accountable if they're unable to make it on time. However, we do ask that people try their best to be punctual, as their delay can be disruptive to the rest of the group. We will contact them and figure out a resolution.  
When someone is late or absent for a group meeting, we try to update that person with everything that has been discussed, with the assistance of the notes taken during the meeting.

All team members should be involved in all the activities, being those related to planning, conflict resolution or coding. Naturally, the work will be split among the members, but all components of the application will have the contribution of everyone.

## Dealing With Conflicts

When a disagreement occurs within the group, a 1v1 battle between the team members shall take place within Minecraft. As aforementioned, with two people not getting along our conflict resolution plan should work well as it gives the members the possibility to let off some steam and take their mind off the project for a bit in order to properly reset mentally. For specific disagreements such as within a piece of code this strategy should also still work as it will let us reach a concrete decision quickly, as usually discussions can stall on for ages with little to no progress. Group 67 If there is still a disagreement (or a draw in Minecraft), and it is not resolvable by a group discussion (and vote, if necessary), then we should ask a TA or course staff to step in.

## Communication

As a group our main forms of communication are Discord and WhatsApp. We use Mattermost to communicate with the teaching assistant.

## Consequences

We will support each other throughout the project. If consistent issues occur, they will be addressed according to the agreed code of conduct.

If someone misses a meeting, they are obligated to bring cookies to the next meeting and getting back on track will be their responsibility, but the group will be available for clarifications and the meeting notes will be shared with all members to be used as a reference to stay on track.

If a person misses multiple meetings we will try our best to help them work out the communication issues, however, ultimately, this behaviour might lead to action from the course staff. The same holds for missing work and deadlines.

## Commitment

We rely heavily on feedback from other group members, leaders and our teaching assistant to gauge each one's commitment and work quality.  

We track the number of absences for each member, as well as the number of meetings they have attended. This information can help us identify members who may be struggling, or who are not meeting our expectations.

We rely on each member's sense of responsibility to assure that the work is done to the best of their ability.

Furthermore, the group is heavily involved in giving feedback on specific issues (code reviews) and general behaviours (retrospective meetings), to ensure that the final product has everyone's contribution and follows their highest standards.
